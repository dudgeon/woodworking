First iteration of this design.

Very few deviations from Peter Parfit's design:

- Designed for construction entirely from 0.249 mm Ply, vs. a mix of hardwood thicknesses
- Made widths equal for left/right compartments of main box
- Added box joints/tabs to allow glue-only assembly
- Changes hole sizes/configuration for screwdriver compartments
- Added holes to bottoms of screwdriver compartments to allow evacuation of dropped parts
- Eyeballed dimensions for carrying handle
